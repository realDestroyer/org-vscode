Release highlights:

- Heading planning decorations: optional CLOSED-on-heading decoration via Org-vscode.decorateHeadingClosedDates (default false); repeating tasks prefer the last CLOSED stamp
- Syntax Color Customizer: fixed packaged webview load issues, added CSP-safe live preview, and hardened against malformed editor.tokenColorCustomizations

See docs/CHANGELOG.md for full details.
