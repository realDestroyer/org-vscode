#+TITLE: Repro - Ctrl+Left/Right steals CLOSED

This file reproduces a bug where `Ctrl+Right` / `Ctrl+Left` (toggle status)
could insert a `CLOSED:` planning line even when toggling into non-done states.

Steps:
1) Put the caret on the first headline.
2) Press Ctrl+Right.

Before fix:
- The first headline could get a `CLOSED:` planning line copied from the next headline.

Expected:
- Only insert/update `CLOSED:` when transitioning *to* a done-like state that stamps CLOSED.
- Never inherit planning from the next headline.

* Skibbidy rizzle (forgive me...my children told me the task needed to be named this lol)
* DONE Next task that already has CLOSED
