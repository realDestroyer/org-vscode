## 🚀 What is Org-vscode?

Organize your thoughts, tasks, projects, and notes — all inside VSCode — using a minimal Org file format powered by Unicode symbols and intuitive keyboard controls.

Whether you're an Emacs power user or just want a highly structured task system, Org-vscode is built to help you:

* Stay focused
* Schedule your work
* Track task progress
* Visually plan via calendar and agenda views
* Tag tasks/projects
* Search/open files based on tag or title
* Export current active tasks for quick review
* Quickly build tables, checklists, and templates
* Work entirely from the keyboard

## 🧩 Core Features

✅ **Unicode Task States**
`⊙` TODO, `⊘` IN\_PROGRESS, `⊜` CONTINUED, `⊖` DONE, `⊗` ABANDONED

📅 **Agenda View**
See all scheduled tasks from all `.org` files in one clean, date-grouped panel. Fully clickable + status toggleable.

📆 **Calendar View**
Drag & drop tasks to reschedule. Filter by tag. Auto-syncs to file.

🏷 **Inline Tagging**
Use `[+TAG:urgent,project]` to categorize tasks. Supports AND/OR logic filtering.

🧠 **Tagged Agenda View**
Filter tasks by one or multiple tags, grouped by file. Click-to-edit support.

🧮 **Table Builder**
Visually generate Org-style tables with alignment, row headers, and optional labels.

📏 **Align Timestamps**
Neatly formats all `SCHEDULED:` timestamps to the same column width.

📤 **Export Active Tasks**
Copy all non-DONE tasks to `CurrentTasks.org` for quick review or reporting.

✂️ **Built-In Snippets**
Use `/todo`, `/template`, `/meeting`, `/checklist`, and more to insert pre-styled blocks.
