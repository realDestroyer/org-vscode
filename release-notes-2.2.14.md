Release highlights:

- Fix: reopening a done-like task back to TODO no longer stamps CLOSED (Fixes #93)
- Agenda View: includes DEADLINE-only tasks and an optional (default-on) UNDATED section (Fixes #95)
- Tagged Agenda: now labels items as SCHEDULED / DEADLINE / UNDATED, adds an UNDATED section, and includes an all-status reporting mode via Org-vscode.taggedAgendaIncludeAllStatuses (default true)

See docs/CHANGELOG.md for full details.
