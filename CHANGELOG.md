# Change Log

# [1.7.1] 08-04-25
`Refactored`

- Centralized Task Keyword/Symbol Manager:
  - All logic for task keyword transitions, symbol assignment, and completion stamps is now handled by a new manager (`taskKeywordManager.js`).
  - Refactored all relevant files (`keywordLeft.js`, `keywordRight.js`, `agenda.js`, `taggedAgenda.js`, and recommended for `calendar.js`) to use this manager, eliminating duplicated logic and ensuring consistent behavior across all views and commands.
  - Blank lines or notes now default to TODO when keyword rotation is triggered.
  - This refactor improves maintainability, reliability, and future extensibility of task status handling throughout the extension.

# [1.7.0] 06-20-25
`Enhanced`

- **Calendar View Rework:**
  - Task tags are now interactive: tag "bubbles" are displayed above the calendar, one for each unique tag found in the currently visible tasks.
  - Clicking a tag filters the visible tasks in the calendar to only those matching the tag.
  - Ctrl+Clicking tag bubbles allows multiple tags to be selected (OR logic).
  - When tags are selected, unselected tags are visually desaturated (grayed out) for clarity.
  - If no tags are selected, all tasks and tags remain colorful.
  - Enhanced styling and clarity around filtering behavior.

# [1.6.9] 06-14-25
`Enhanced`

- Unified Task Symbols:
  - Updated all internal functions (Agenda View, Tagged Agenda View, Calendar View, keywordLeft/Right, etc.) to support the new Unicode task symbols:
    - ‚äô TODO
    - ‚äò IN_PROGRESS
    - ‚äú CONTINUED
    - ‚äñ DONE
    - ‚äó ABANDONED
  - Symbols are now accurately rotated in both source files and supporting views.
  - Agenda and Tagged Agenda Views now update the keyword correctly while intentionally hiding the Unicode symbol for a cleaner look.

- Visual Cycling Behavior:
  - Stopped infinite cycling: you can no longer rotate beyond TODO (left) or ABANDONED (right).
  - COMPLETED timestamps are reliably added or removed when toggling to/from DONE in every view.
  - Cleaned symbol detection logic to prevent keyword misfires (e.g. detecting "DONE" inside "ABANDONED").

`Fixed`

- Unicode-aware task matching:
  - Substring-matching bugs are now eliminated using stricter regex to detect keywords correctly (e.g. DONE was falsely matched inside ABANDONED).
  - Symbol detection logic in task movement (moveUp / moveDown) updated to use the full Unicode task set.

`Added`

- Message Utility Activation:
  - Fully integrated and exposed the previously unused `showMessage.js` feature.
  - A new command (`extension.showMessageTest`) displays an information popup with a customizable message and button.
  - Added a `Ctrl + Alt + M` keybinding for testing the GitHub redirect example.

# [1.6.8] 05-15-25
`Fixed`

- Open By Tag:
  - Restored support for opening .org files by tag from the #+TAGS: header using the VS-Org: Open By Tag command.
  - The previous version only supported .vsorg files and silently ignored .org files.
  - Updated logic to support both extensions, clean up blank entries, and normalize tag casing for accurate matching. üîç‚ú®
  - You can now confidently open any project by tag, no matter which file type or case it's in!

# [1.6.7] 05-07-25
`Enhanced`

- Tag Insertion:
  - When adding a new tag to a task using the addTag command, the extension now checks the file‚Äôs #+TAGS: header at the top.
  - If the tag isn‚Äôt already listed, it will automatically be added to the #+TAGS: line, keeping the header in sync with inline tags. üí™
  - This makes it easier to spot what kinds of projects or contexts a file includes‚Äîespecially when quickly skimming or using global tag search.
  - Existing tags in the header are preserved, and no duplicates will be added.


# [1.6.6] 04-30-25
`Fixed`
- Fixed a bug where tasks containing commas in their description (e.g. ‚ÄúWork on mock interview questions, etc.‚Äù) would fail to update their status.
- The issue was caused by parsing the message.text on commas without safely escaping them. The text was split mid-sentence, causing the update logic to fail to find the original task line.
- Commas in task text and scheduled date fields are now safely encoded and decoded during message passing between the webview and extension backend. üéØ


## [1.6.5] 04-29-25
`Fixed`

- Tagged Agenda View:
  - Fixed the erroneously added "cw" letters in a loop. My guess is, I must've been typing on a different window or playing Counter-Strike and alt+tabbed while playing with VSCode in the background and an automated deployment must've kicked off.

## [1.6.4] 04-24-25
`Fixed`

- Tagged Agenda View:
  - COMPLETED timestamps now use a consistent long-form style (e.g. 25th March 2025, 8:35:37 am) when toggling to DONE, matching the format used in the main Agenda View and status change commands.
  - Previously, marking a task as DONE in the Tagged Agenda View inserted a shortened ISO date (e.g. 2025-03-25). This has been updated for consistency and readability.
  - Fixed a parsing bug where the time portion (including seconds) of the COMPLETED timestamp was being truncated due to incorrect handling of commas in message payloads.


## [1.6.3] 04-23-25

`Fixed`

- Agenda View:
  - COMPLETED timestamps now match the correct long-form style (e.g. 23rd April 2025, 7:46:58 am) for consistency with keywordLeft / keywordRight actions.
  - Previously, toggling to DONE in the Agenda View used an ISO format (e.g. 2025-04-23). This has been updated to keep formatting consistent across features.

## [1.6.2] 04-21-25

`Added`

- Calendar View Enhancements:
  - Tags are now visually extracted and displayed as colored bubbles above the calendar
  - Tasks are color-coded by their primary tag
  - Tag colors are assigned dynamically (no hardcoding required)
  - Rescheduling via drag-and-drop now correctly handles tasks with inline tags

`Fixed`
